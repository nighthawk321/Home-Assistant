# Home-Assistant
My current set up for my home automation is based on an old computer running ubuntu 20.04 LTS and docker

Current Hardware-

Echo dot 

Zemissmart curtan rail converted to Tasmoto (OTA)

2 Ikea light bulb

Hue motion sensor

Aqua motion sensors x2

2 Teckin SP23 plugs, Tasmota converted

1 Aoycocr U3S plugs, Tasmota converted

Roku3

Raspberry 4B running Kodi/libreelec

Sonnoff zigbee bridge running tasmota.

Software/apps
Currently running the android app lite on lineage OS but restricted use with no google services. Ideally this depenancy on google servies nees to be changed.
