# Home-Assistant
My current set up for my home automation is based on Hassio running on a Raspberry Pi 4 2gb

Current Hardware-

Echo dot 

Zemissmart curtan rail converted to Tasmoto (OTA)

2 Ikea light bulb

Hue motion sensor 

Roku3

Raspberry 3B running Kodi/libreelec

Zigbee2mqtt added to set up, works fine

Software/apps
No phone apps currently used as the ubuntu touch app is broken and unmaintained. The android app requires google services so it will not work on my ONplus3t phone
