# Home-Assistant
My current set up for my home automation is based on Hassio running on a Raspberry Pi 3b

Current Hardware-

Echo dot 

Zemissmart curtan rail converted to Tasmoto (OTA)

2 Hue LED white lights

Hue motion sensor 

Roku3

Raspberry 3B running Kodi/libreelec

Zigbee2mqtt added to set up, works fine

Software/apps
Offical Home assistant app for Android 
Yatse for controlling kodi

Tracking is now done through the android app although I am now carriying a Ubuntu touch phone which has a home assistant but it appears to be buggy and out dated and not mantained. Seriously though it still works but needs updating badly!
