# Home-Assistant
My current set up for my home automation is based on Hassio running on a Raspberry Pi4 2gb

Current Hardware-

Software/apps
Currently running the android app lite on lineage OS but restricted use with no google services. Ideally this depenancy on google servies nees to be changed.
